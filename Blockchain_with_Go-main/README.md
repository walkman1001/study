# Blockchain_with_Go
**Use golang to reproduce the basic blockchain**

### Update Panel
* V0.1 No transactions but noly blocks are allowed.
* V0.5 Transactions are now supported. One block can have multiple transactions.
* V1.0 The UTXO module has been just supported. Users can now publish transactions to reallocate the coins.
* V1.1 Wallet module has been added, but it is not fully supported by the blockchain yet.
* V1.2 Now you can use the wallet address to make TxOutputs. Also you can use wallet address to refer the transactions.
* V1.5 There is a big jump in this version. Wallet module can be fully supported (Signature and Validation has been done), and even an API for the future mining functionality has been created.
* V1.6 Now supports the Merkle Tree and SPV.
* V1.7 Add UTXO sets to accelerate finding the spendable outputs of a wallet instead of go through the whole blockchain.


### Insight Future
<font color='red'> **Time is now to go straight forward to construct the P2P network step by step!**</font>
* Write server and client programs. It should follow the P2P protocal and seperate the nodes into full nodes and others.
* Activate the mining mechanism of the network.
* Realize the self-adaption of difficulty (using RPC).

### How to test and use
Recently I have made a .bat to test my program. If you want to know how to learn from this half-way program, just run the test.bat and see what I have done at this stage.
